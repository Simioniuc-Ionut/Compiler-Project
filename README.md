# Compiler-Project 
  
This application embodies a compilation of its own language, complete with its unique syntax, grammar, and semantics. The compiler acknowledges various data types, variables, functions, classes, methods, objects, expressions, and numerous other elements.
 In files in.txt and in1.txt you could find some examples of inputs. The result of compilation will be displayed in an out.txt file.
